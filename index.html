Tigers cry too is going to be a website that has a shopping cart. The main motivation behind the name is that strong people (tigers) can still cry and that's ok.  

It's a loose sketchy, intentionally non realistic style.  So the colors for the site and the feel of the site should feel like her art.

On the home page there needs to be a page where they go to submit ideas for her to make a commissioned piece. Maybe it's a simple form, maybe there are some questions about what they want drawn or painted.  Maybe there are some reference images to help them describe what they want.

There needs to be a shopping cart page with a good number of items that she can swap out as she makes new material.

There needs to be a mental health page where she shares advice or her journey and links to other resources. 

The home page needs to have links to her social media - I'm not sure what platforms she is on besides linkedin and instagram.
